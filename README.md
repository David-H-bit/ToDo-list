- ðŸ”² **Task Validation**: Prevent creation of empty tasks
- ðŸ”² **Global Task Management**: Tasks should only be addable within specific lists
- ðŸ”² **Data Persistence**: Save tasks to localStorage
- ðŸ”² **Task Categories**: Better organization and tagging system
- ðŸ”² **Task sorting**: Sort tasks by due date, creation date or priority
- ðŸ”² **Other**: Undo for recent deletes, Keyboard shortcuts, Character limit indicators, better/cleaner CSS

## Technologies Used
